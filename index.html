      <h1><b>üìä Nutrient Tracking</b></h1>
      <p>Nutrition tracking is the process of monitoring the foods you consume and understanding how they impact your health. It involves logging your daily intake of calories, macronutrients (carbs, proteins, fats), and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals). This helps you make more informed decisions and stay aligned with your health goals ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs weight loss, muscle gain, managing diabetes, or simply maintaining a balanced diet.</p>
